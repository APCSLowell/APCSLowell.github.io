Lightning
=========
In this assignment you will create a program that uses a [random walk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FVMky4RCdS__va05BmkkpeWqi83gpj458w98yif5H6A/edit?usp=sharing) to seemingly shoot lightning from one side of the screen to the other each time the mouse is pressed. You may find slides 16 to 52 of the [apjavaProcessing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqbareaFmF9fMcp0XOl3hRO6hAlrU5WIaj4V-Kd3eDI/edit?usp=sharing) presentation helpful.

Suggested steps to start the assignment
------------------------------------------
1. First, sign up for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. Then, _fork_ [this repository](https://github.com/APCSLowell/Lightning)
3. Open `Lightning.pde` and copy the code into Processing
4. At the top of the program in Processing, declare 4 `int` variables `startX`, `startY`, `endX` and `endY`. Initialize `startX` to 0, `startY` to 150, `endX` to 0 and `endY` to 150
5. `void setup()` needs to set the `size()`, `strokeWeight()` and `background()` of your program
6. `void draw()` needs to do two things:
	- Set the `stroke()` color of the lightning bolt to a random value using `Math.random()`
	- Use a `while` loop to repeat the following steps until the `endX` is off-screen:
		- Set `endX` to `startX` plus a random integer from 0 to 9
		- Set `endY` to `startY` plus a random integer from -9 to 9
		- Draw a `line()` with endpoints `startX`, `startY`, `endX`, `endY`
		- Set `startX` equal to `endX`
		- Set `startY` equal to `endY`
7. `void mousePressed()` needs to set `startX`, `startY`, `endX`, `endY` back to their original values.
8. When you are happy with the program, copy and paste it back into GitHub
9. You will also need to modify `index.html` to customize your website with its own title, headline and footer. When you are happy with your program, push your finished project up to GitHub
10. Finally, submit the URL for your website to Google Classroom. You can find more specific instructions with pictures on how to submit your assignment on slides 50 to 52 of the [apjavaProcessing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqbareaFmF9fMcp0XOl3hRO6hAlrU5WIaj4V-Kd3eDI/edit?usp=sharing) slide presentation. Don't hesitate to ask for help if your aren't sure how something is suppose to work.

Program requirements
-----------------------
The steps above are only a suggestion. Your program needs to use `Math.random()` for *all* random numbers in the assignment. Other than that, your lightning program doesn't have to work or look like any other. Have fun and be creative!

GitHub problems?
----------------
If your program works in Processing but not on GitHub, check [this list](https://github.com/APCSLowell/WebDebugging/blob/master/README.md#help-my-program-runs-in-processing-but-not-on-github) for possible solutions. If your program still isn't working on GitHub let your instructor know.
